### Geoffrey Millard, PhD

I am currently a physical scientist with the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  I am currently working on projects focused on cleaning up sites contaminated with metals (primarily mercury) accross the United States.  I earned my PhD at Syracuse University working with Dr. Charles Driscoll on mercury related projects in New York, U.S.A.  I have lead several introductory workshops for coding in R and Python.  I currently use R/Python for data wrangling, cleaning, visualization, statistics and reproducable research.
